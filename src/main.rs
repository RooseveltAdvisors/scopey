const LONG_ABOUT: &str = r#"scopey observes supported coding-agent sessions and keeps them aligned
with the user's current active scope.

HOW IT WORKS
  1. `scopey setup` installs lifecycle hooks or extensions into supported harnesses.
  2. On each user prompt, hooks call `scopey hook user-prompt` which:
       - caches the prompt under ~/.scopey/work/<escaped-cwd>/<session>.json
       - runs a cheap model through the selected harness to extract scope requirements
  3. Every N tool calls (config: n_tool_calls), hooks call `scopey hook post-tool` which:
       - journals a trajectory pointer
       - if a prior background judgement was off-track, emits injection JSON
         (scope requirements + judgement) for the hook to feed the model
       - every M tool calls, emits a lighter scope-reminder injection
       - starts a new background judgement over the last N tool-call window
         (course-correction therefore lags by ~2N tool calls)
  4. When a judgement is off_track, scopey also fires a desktop notification.

SESSION FILES
  Keyed by session_id (stable across cwd changes):
    ~/.scopey/work/by-id/<session_id>.json
  Legacy cwd-keyed files are migrated on open.

  Message types stored in the session: user_prompt, scope_requirements,
  trajectory_mark, judgement, injection, note.

HOOK CONTRACT
  Hook commands read the harness JSON event on stdin and may print JSON on
  stdout for the harness to inject as additionalContext. They must stay fast
  (background work is detached). Never print plain text unless you intend it
  as model-visible context.

CONFIG
  ~/.scopey/config.toml  (created by `scopey setup`)
  Project overlay: <cwd>/.scopey/config.toml  (optional, merges over user)

FOR MODELS DRIVING SCOPEY
  Prefer `scopey <cmd> --help` for the exact flags of a command. Use
  `scopey doctor` to verify install. Use `scopey status` to inspect a session.
  Do not reimplement path escaping — call `scopey path escape --cwd <dir>`.

How Scopey works, in one paragraph: while an agent session runs, Scopey
periodically takes the last stretch of tool calls (a "check") and asks a small
model whether that work still matches what you asked for. A check comes back
on-track, warning, or off-track. When a check is flagged (warning/off-track),
Scopey can send the session a course correction.

WHAT THE METRICS MEAN

  checks             Completed judgements. Each covers a window of recent
                     tool calls, judged against your request's scope.
  flagged            A check that came back warning or off-track.
  flag rate          Flagged checks / completed checks. High = Scopey kept
                     objecting to the session's work.
  failed to run      Checks whose model call errored ("unknown" verdict).
                     No opinion was produced; treat as missing, not clean.
  no tool evidence   "insufficient-evidence": the window held no visible
                     tool activity, so Scopey refused to judge it.
  drift patterns     Aggregates over flagged checks only:
    work involved      What the flagged work was (keyword categories such as
                       unauthorized tests, vcs/release, out-of-scope files).
                       One check can match several categories.
    onset chart        WHEN flags happen inside a session: left edge =
                       session start, right edge = end. "half of all flags
                       by tool N" marks the middle of the distribution.
    stated/implied     Whether the violated scope spelled out a restriction
                       ("do not edit files") or only implied one.
    flag rate by       Longer sessions are checked more often; this table
    session length     shows where flags actually concentrate.
  course corrections Messages Scopey injected after an off-track/warning
                     check. "back on-track next check" = the very next
                     check passed; "drifted again" = it did not.
  scopey overhead    Measured analyzer tokens Scopey itself spent on the
                     session (its summarize and judge calls), recorded from
                     the model CLI's own usage output as the session runs.
                     A floor, never an estimate: calls whose runner exposes
                     no usage are not counted. These calls go to the
                     configured fast model (by default a cheap model such
                     as haiku, not the main-session model), and the report
                     names that model next to the spend.
  tokens             Provider-reported token counters read from each
                     session's transcript, attributed to the main-session
                     model(s) by name. Cache reads are input tokens the
                     provider served from its prompt cache (billed at a deep
                     discount); fresh input and output are full price.
                     Token totals count volume, not dollars — so comparing
                     main-model volume against Scopey's fast-model overhead
                     overstates Scopey's relative cost in dollars.

Zero-tool stores are excluded by default; use --include-empty to audit raw
history. Date-only values use the local timezone. Machine-readable field
names in --json are stable and may differ from the display labels.

Examples:
  scopey insights
  scopey insights --off-scope --since 2026-07-01
  scopey insights --session 019fb598 --details
  scopey insights --date 2026-07-30 --harness codex

Do not call these interactively unless you are replaying a fixture.

Subcommands map to lifecycle events:
  user-prompt    UserPromptSubmit
  session-start  SessionStart
  post-tool      PostToolUse and/or PostToolBatch
  stop           Stop
"#;

const HOOK_USER_PROMPT_ABOUT: &str = r#"Read harness UserPromptSubmit JSON from stdin.

Actions:
  1. Open/create session file for (cwd, session_id)
  2. Append message type=user_prompt
  3. Spawn background `scopey summarize` to refresh scope_requirements
  4. Exit 0 with empty stdout (logging must not inject by accident)

Required stdin fields: session_id, cwd (or use process cwd), prompt
Optional: transcript_path, hook_event_name
"#;

const HOOK_SESSION_START_ABOUT: &str = r#"Read harness SessionStart JSON from stdin.

Ensures the session file exists and records harness/source. No model call.
"#;

const HOOK_POST_TOOL_ABOUT: &str = r#"Read harness PostToolUse or PostToolBatch JSON from stdin.

Actions:
  1. Increment tool_call_count (batch events count each tool in the batch)
  2. If a ready off_track/warning judgement exists → print injection JSON
     containing scope requirements + judgement (then mark judgement injected)
  3. Else if tool_call_count % m_reminder == 0 → print scope reminder injection
  4. If tool_call_count % n_tool_calls == 0 → journal trajectory_mark and
     spawn background `scopey judge` for the last N window
  5. Exit 0

Injection JSON (Claude-compatible):
  {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"<event>","additionalContext":"..."}}

Codex also accepts the same additionalContext shape.
"#;

const HOOK_STOP_ABOUT: &str = r#"Read harness Stop JSON from stdin.

If there is a ready non-injected off_track judgement, emit injection JSON so
the model sees the correction before the user continues. Does not force-continue
the agent loop by itself (harness Stop decision:block is left to the user/hook
wrapper if desired).
"#;

const JUDGE_ABOUT: &str = r#"Judge recent trajectory against scope requirements using the cheap model.

Normally spawned in the background by `scopey hook post-tool`. Writes a
judgement message into the session file. On off_track, triggers notify.

Example:
  scopey judge --session-id sid --cwd . --from-count 0 --to-count 10 \
    --transcript-path ~/.claude/projects/.../sid.jsonl
"#;

const SUMMARIZE_ABOUT: &str = r#"Build/replace the current active scope after the latest user prompt.

The latest prompt is an authoritative mutation that can add, subtract, modify,
or replace scope. Unaffected requirements survive additions/modifications;
questions remain read-only. Each transition is recorded in the session log.
Uses model_runner + model from config. Intended for background use after prompts.

Example:
  scopey summarize --session-id sid --cwd .
"#;

const NOTIFY_ABOUT: &str = r#"Send a notification the same way off-track alerts do.

Backend (config notify_backend, default auto):
  herdr  → herdr notification show when Herdr is available (inside a Herdr
           pane or server running). In-app toast when ui.toast.delivery=herdr.
  os     → macOS osascript / Linux notify-send (always desktop)
  auto   → Herdr when available, else OS
  command → run notify_command template

Uses config notify_sound / herdr_notify_sound unless --sound is passed.
For full customization, set notify_* keys in ~/.scopey/config.toml.

Examples:
  scopey notify --title scopey --body "Session may be off-track"
  scopey notify --title scopey --body "test" --sound request
"#;

const LOGS_ABOUT: &str = r#"Read structured per-session debug logs written by scopey hooks and jobs.

Log path:
  ~/.scopey/logs/<session_id>.jsonl

Each line is JSON with: ts, level, session_id, event, message, pid, internal, fields.

Examples:
  scopey logs
  scopey logs --session abc123
  scopey logs --session abc123 --tail 50
  scopey logs --session abc123 --level warn
  scopey logs --session abc123 --event guard
  scopey logs --session abc123 --follow
  scopey logs --session abc123 --path
  scopey logs --session abc123 --raw
"#;

const PURGE_ABOUT: &str = r#"SIGTERM leaked background workers that can storm the machine:

  - `scopey summarize` / `scopey judge` processes
  - stale per-session job lock files

Safe to run any time hooks feel stuck or CPU spikes from recursive headless Claude.

Example:
  scopey purge
"#;

const HERDR_ABOUT: &str = r#"Inspect Herdr awareness and optionally probe its notification API.

Herdr (https://herdr.dev) is an agent multiplexer. When agents run inside a
Herdr pane they export HERDR_ENV / HERDR_SOCKET_PATH / HERDR_PANE_ID.

scopey uses:
  herdr notification show <title> --body … --sound request|done|none
  herdr pane report-agent <pane> --source scopey --state blocked …

Toast delivery is controlled by Herdr config `[ui.toast] delivery`:
  off | herdr | terminal | system

scopey config:
  notify_backend = "auto"   # auto|herdr|os|command
  herdr_report_state = true
  notify_fallback_os_if_herdr_disabled = true

Examples:
  scopey herdr
  scopey herdr --probe
"#;

const MODELS_ABOUT: &str = r#"Explain and verify lightweight model selection for summarize/judge.

Resolution rules (config defaults in parentheses):
  model_runner = auto|claude|codex|grok|pi|opencode   (auto)
  model        = auto|<slug>         (auto)

When model_runner=auto, the session harness wins when its CLI is available.

When model=auto, use the product's shipped fast tier:
  Claude   → claude_fast_model
  Codex    → codex_fast_model
  Grok     → grok_fast_model
  Pi       → pi_fast_model, or its configured provider default
  OpenCode → opencode_fast_model, or its configured provider default

Examples:
  scopey models
  scopey models --verify
  make verify-models
